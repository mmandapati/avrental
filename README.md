The application can be used for booking Autonomous vehicles (AV) to commute from one place to the other. The services provided by our application are booking ride, enrolling to subscription plan, status tracking and sensor data monitoring of the vehicle. We have integrated CARLA simulator with our application to derive real time sensor data of the A V . This application is highly available, scalable, and capable of meeting any requirements posed by huge datasets generated by users and vehicle sensorsas we have deployed ourentire application onto the AWS cloud service
